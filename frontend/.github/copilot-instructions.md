<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This is a portfolio website project built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The project uses the following key technologies:

## Tech Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the UI framework
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for component library and styling
- **GSAP** for advanced animations and transitions
- **Anime.js** for additional animation effects
- **Emotion** for CSS-in-JS styling

## Project Structure
- Components should be organized in `src/components/` directory
- Each major section (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact) should have its own component
- Animation utilities should be in `src/utils/animations/`
- Types should be defined in `src/types/`

## Coding Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement TypeScript strictly with proper typing
- Use MUI components and theming system
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use GSAP for complex animations and Anime.js for simpler effects
- Follow modern React patterns and best practices
- Ensure accessibility (a11y) standards are met

## Animation Guidelines
- Use GSAP for timeline-based animations and scroll-triggered effects
- Use Anime.js for element entrance animations and micro-interactions
- Implement smooth scroll and parallax effects where appropriate
- Ensure animations are performant and don't impact accessibility
